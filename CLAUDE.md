# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Pi RTK Surveyor project that creates a professional-grade RTK surveying station using a Raspberry Pi. The system provides centimeter-level GPS accuracy for property mapping and topographical surveying at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions.

## Architecture

The codebase uses a simplified, integrated architecture:

### Core Components
- **main.py**: Integrated application containing bootloader, base station, and rover functionality
- **hardware/**: Hardware abstraction layer for GPIO, OLED display, buttons, and system monitoring
- **common/**: Shared utilities including GPS controller, NMEA parsing, data logging, and communication protocols
- **web/**: Web interface for base station remote monitoring

### Key Architecture Patterns
- All functionality is contained in a single PiRTKSurveyor class in main.py
- Hardware components are initialized once and shared across all modes
- Mode selection switches between different operational states within the same application
- GPIO management is centralized through gpio_manager.py
- Display management uses luma.oled with custom screens and UI elements
- System runs as a systemd service with proper resource limits and security settings

## Development Commands

### Installation and Setup
```bash
# Initial setup (run as regular user, not root)
./setup.sh

# Enable SPI/I2C interfaces after setup
sudo raspi-config
# Interface Options > SPI > Enable
# Interface Options > I2C > Enable

# CRITICAL: Disable Bluetooth to free UART for GPS
sudo bash -c 'echo "dtoverlay=disable-bt" >> /boot/firmware/config.txt'
sudo systemctl disable hciuart.service
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service

# Reboot to apply all changes
sudo reboot
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start manually
./start.sh

# Service management
./service.sh start|stop|restart|status|logs|enable|disable

# Run with specific log level
python3 src/main.py --log-level DEBUG
```

### Python Environment
- Uses virtual environment at `./venv/`
- Dependencies managed via `requirements.txt`
- All Python commands should use `./venv/bin/python`

### Testing and Development
```bash
# View live logs
./service.sh logs

# Check system status
./service.sh status

# Manual testing (stop service first)
./service.sh stop
python3 src/main.py --log-level DEBUG
```

## Hardware Dependencies

This project is designed for real hardware testing only - no simulation modes:
- Raspberry Pi Zero W 2 (or any Pi with GPIO)
- LC29H GNSS RTK HAT for GPS functionality
- Waveshare 1.3" OLED HAT for display and button controls
- Requires SPI and I2C interfaces enabled
- **CRITICAL**: Bluetooth must be disabled to free UART for GPS communication

### GPIO Pin Allocations
- **UART** for LC29H GPS (pins 8/10 - TXD/RXD)
- SPI for OLED display (pins 19, 23, 24 + GPIO 24, 25)
- I2C for additional sensors
- GPIO pins 21, 20, 16 for buttons (KEY1, KEY2, KEY3)
- Joystick on GPIO pins 6, 19, 5, 26, 13

### UART Configuration Requirements
The LC29H GPS module requires exclusive access to the Pi's main UART (/dev/ttyAMA0). By default, Raspberry Pi OS assigns this UART to Bluetooth, which prevents GPS communication. The system automatically disables Bluetooth during setup to ensure GPS functionality.

### ðŸŽ¯ Detailed Implementation Plan

#### Task 1: GNSS Hardware Integration (IMMEDIATE)
**File**: `src/main.py` (lines 92-94, 122-124)
**Goal**: Replace GPS simulation with real hardware initialization

**Current Issue**: GPS controller is initialized but runs in simulation mode
```python
# Current (line 93): 
self.gps_controller = LC29HController()
# Needs to become:
self.gps_controller = LC29HController(port='/dev/ttyAMA0', baudrate=38400, simulate=False)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add GPS hardware detection in `initialize_hardware()` method
2. Implement fallback to simulation if hardware not detected
3. Add proper error handling for GPS connection failures
4. Update `_update_monitoring_data()` to use real GPS data instead of placeholders
5. Test with actual LC29H RTK HAT hardware

- Coordinate system transformation between sectors
- Data merging and export for CAD software
- Sector boundary management

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Design survey/sector data structure

**Files**: `src/web/templates/`, `src/web/web_server.py`
**Goal**: Simplify web interface to focus only on monitoring (remove config pages)

**Changes Needed**:
1. Remove config.html template and routes
2. Focus dashboard.html on real-time monitoring only
3. Optimize for mobile/tablet viewing
4. Remove configuration API endpoints that change hardware settings

### ðŸ”§ Development Commands for Implementation

```bash
# Test GPS hardware integration
./service.sh stop
python3 src/main.py --log-level DEBUG

# Test point logging
# [After implementation] Use KEY3 button in rover mode to log points

# Test web dashboard
# [After web server starts] Visit http://pi-ip:5000 for dashboard

# Check data files
ls -la data/surveys/
cat data/surveys/latest_survey.csv

# Troubleshooting GPS connection
# Check if UART devices exist
ls -la /dev/tty* | grep -E "(AMA|serial)"

# Check if Bluetooth is disabled
dmesg | grep -i uart
# Should NOT show "hci_uart_bcm" if Bluetooth is properly disabled

# Test UART directly
sudo cat /dev/ttyAMA0
# Should show NMEA sentences starting with $ if GPS is working
```

## Testing Philosophy

**We will not test with simulated data. We will develop for production, and a developer will test on real hardware for validation.**

This project is designed from the ground up for real hardware operation. All development assumes:
- Actual LC29H GNSS RTK HAT hardware
- Real GPIO pins and hardware interfaces
- Production-grade error handling and recovery
- True RTK performance validation

Simulation modes are provided only as fallbacks when hardware is not detected, not for primary development or testing. All features must be validated on actual Raspberry Pi hardware with the LC29H RTK HAT before being considered complete.

## Important Notes

- Never run setup.sh as root - it handles sudo internally where needed
- Hardware interfaces (SPI/I2C) must be enabled via raspi-config before first use
- The system uses systemd for service management with security restrictions
- All hardware operations require actual GPIO pins - this is not a simulation-friendly codebase
- **Simplified Architecture**: All functionality is integrated into main.py - no separate modules to import
- Mode selection (BASE/ROVER) switches operational states within the same running application
- Button events are processed through a centralized ButtonAPI system with mode-specific handlers
- Display updates use the luma.oled library with custom screen implementations
- **Development Strategy**: Keep WiFi hotspot disabled during development to maintain Pi connectivity
- **Testing Requirements**: All features must be validated on real hardware before release
